# Adult-Income
This is my first project as a data analyst using python and power bi tools.
Dataset was pulled from Kaggle ['link'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset/data)
The data shows the income of some ages, gender, martial-status and types of education and workclasses.
My job was to clean and process this data to get multiple relationships between these factors to detect the corresponding income for them.
